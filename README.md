# Speaker Together

Most conferences [I spoke at in 2020](https://ticofab.io/talks/) were remote,
and it looks like this trend is not reversing anytime soon. One of the
things I miss the most about the IRL events are the speaker dinners.

While looking at the [JLove 2020](https://jlove.konfy.care/) speakers,
I wondered how many of them I "crossed" at previous conferences without even realizing.
So I sat down, collected data from all the events that I spoke at before
and wrote this little scripty app to crunch the (tiny) numbers.

For instance, this is how many times I crossed before the speakers of JLove 2020:

## Evolution of this project

I am going to update this project with as my speaking data grows.

While I don't plan to make this more complex than it is now, if other folks find this
interesting, we could work together and expand both dataset and functionality. 

Do get in touch if that's the case!
